When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Teamwork. Volatile workstations. Important, can't-be-lost-ever, code with a strict deadline

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Conflicts would be resolved when you are ready, instead of when Git says you're ready.
